# CS492 ML for NLP Fall 2019

## Course Description

This course will cover important problems and concepts in natural language processing and the machine learning models used in those problems.

## Prerequisites:  

1. Good programming skills in Python.
2. Basic understanding of ML concepts. You do not need to have taken CS376 or any other undergraduate ML course, but you need to know concepts such as train vs test data, clustering vs classification, accuracy/precision/recall, overfitting, and basic classification models such as SVM, random forest, etc.

## Learning Goals

**[INSTRUCTOR NOTE: PLEASE LIST (3-5) LEARNING OUTCOMES]**

By the end of the course, you will be able to

1. Understand important concepts in NLP
1. Read current research papers in NLP 
1. Implement some of the basic ML models for NLP
1. Conduct replication studies based on a recent NLP+ML paper
1. Communicate in written and spoken English about NLP+ML research

## Class Assignments

TBD 

### Projects

You will pick one paper from ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, or TACL, published in 2016 to 2019, and replicate it. You will be required to change at least one thing -- dataset, model, or research question. More details will be given out during the first week of class.

## Evaluation
Your grade will be a combination of the following:

- Participation and attendance 
- Midterm exam
- Paper presentation
- Homework assignments
- Project
